    <p>This is the start of my Sound Design series blog posts, which will cover various aspects of my sound design workflow and misc. other things I learn along the way that are important/relevant to the craft. I am also planning extensive hardware review blog posts(headphones, microphones, synths,..), and plugin reviews.</p>

<p>In the first half of school they taught us in a little known DAW called Digital Performer. The second half was done in Pro Tools in a studio setting. On my own I discovered Logic Pro, Cubase, Ableton Live, and dabbled in Reason. At this point I can design fluently in any DAW, but my preference is Cubase.</p>

<p>Synthesis is half of my sound design workflow. My favorite hardware synth is the Virus TI. My favorite soft-synth is Massive(original). I can work comfortably in any hardware/software synth in any style, but I specialize in wavetable synthesis. I have uncountable hours invested in the original Massive, amassing 20,000+ personally made patches over 8 years.</p>

<p>The second half of my workflow is processing those synth sounds with plugins. The plugins I can’t live without are Fabfilter and Izotope, and I can’t imagine needing anything more than this. Gear/hardware is another story, I could grow my collection forever.</p>

<p>I’ve been tutoring for 3-4 years, re-investing earnings into further private education. In person and through video chat. I teach in the context of neuro bass, but the techniques are fully applicable to any frequency range sounds and any genre.</p>

<p>I am currently available for private tutoring and sound design work. The following sound design series blog posts will include samples of my work.</p>
