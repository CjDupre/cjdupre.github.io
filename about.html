    <p>Hi! My name is CJ. I am a programmer and sound-designer.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always had a deep emotional connection with music, and was fortunate to have the opportunity to self teach guitar from an early age. I attended two years of college for music production, which covered midi, studio operation, audio engineering, music fundamentals, and piano.</p>

<p>During my time in school, searching for my production style, I discovered a love for synthesis. I found myself immersed in the UK bass music production scene, following artists like KOAN Sound and Joe Ford. I saw an ocean of difference between the UK sounds and the American EDM that my peers listened to, and saw an opportunity to contribute something new to the scene.</p>

<p>Over the last eight years, I invested many thousands of hours exploring synthesis, and invested all of my earnings into learning sound-design from established professionals. I realized early on that my own learning would be infinite, as the craft is never ending. So to better support continued learning, I took to teaching sound-design/synthesis one-on-one.</p>

<p>I created this blog to talk about and demonstrate sound-design and synthesis. I will also have a series of posts that deal with software/hardware reviews, and genre education. My hope is that exposure to this information will propel readers to find a strong desire for mastery in this field.</p>

<p>As for programming.. I have experience in web design and app design, using React, React-Native, Javascript, AWS, and others. I am mentored and self taught, but about to start a structured education at a bootcamp. My portfolio is small because I have focused all of my energy on the app project which can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/CjDupre">GitHub</a>. There you will find the front end of the ScreenCache app, and the AWS back end. I am currently open to employment offers.</p>
