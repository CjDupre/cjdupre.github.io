I am also planning extensive hardware review blog posts(headphones, microphones, synths,..), and plugin reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first half of school they taught us in a little known DAW called Digital Performer. The second half was done in Pro Tools in a studio setting. On my own I discovered Logic Pro, Cubase, Ableton Live, and dabbled in Reason. At this point I can design fluently in any DAW, but my preference is Cubase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis is half of my sound design workflow. My favorite hardware synth is the Virus TI. My favorite soft-synth is Massive(original). I can work comfortably in any hardware/software synth in any style, but I specialize in wavetable synthesis. I have uncountable hours invested in the original Massive, amassing 20,000+ personally made patches over 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of my workflow is processing those synth sounds with plugins. The plugins I can’t live without are Fabfilter and Izotope, and I can’t imagine needing anything more than this. Gear/hardware is another story, I could grow my collection forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tutoring for 3-4 years, re-investing earnings into further private education. In person and through video chat. I teach in the context of neuro bass, but the techniques are fully applicable to any frequency range sounds and any genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently available for private tutoring and sound design work. The following sound design series blog posts will include samples of my work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>CJ Dupre</name><email>dupre.pdx@gmail.com</email></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">This is the start of my Sound Design series blog posts, which will cover various aspects of my sound design workflow and misc. other things I learn along the way that are important/relevant to the craft.
